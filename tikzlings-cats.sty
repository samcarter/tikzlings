%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic cat can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[eye=green]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[whiskers=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[paws=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The shape of the \lstinline|pupil| can be changed with the \lstinline|pupilwidth| option:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[pupilwidth=0.015]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%Additionally several predefined widths exist:
%\begin{tcolorbox}
%\begin{lstlisting}[morekeywords={narrow,medium,wide,very,pupils}]
%\cat[narrow pupils]
%
%\cat[medium pupils]
%
%\cat[wide pupils]
%
%\cat[very wide pupils]
%\end{lstlisting} 
%
%\tcblower
%\begin{tikzpicture}[yshift=2.4cm,xshift=1.8cm]
%\cat[narrow pupils]
%\cat[medium pupils,xshift=2.5cm]
%\cat[wide pupils,yshift=-2.5cm]
%\cat[very wide pupils,xshift=2.5cm,yshift=-2.5cm]
%\end{tikzpicture}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%There is also the special option \lstinline|schroedinger|. This cat is both alive and dead as long as you did not compile your document.
%Be prepared for a possibly disturbing scene when you open the pdf, this option is not suited for sensitive \tikzlings.

%\cat[schroedinger]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\endgroup
%
%To view the cat from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the cat 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\cat[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
