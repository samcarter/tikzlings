%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}

%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic owl can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[bill=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the owl from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the owl 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\owl[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
