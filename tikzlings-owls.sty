%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic owl}}
%\owl
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic owl can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\owl[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\owl[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil colour}}
%\owl[pupils=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Bill colour}}
%\owl[bill=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\owl[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the owl from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\owl[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the owl 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\owl[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\owl[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
