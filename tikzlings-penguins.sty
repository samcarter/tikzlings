%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic penguin}}
%\penguin
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic penguin can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\penguin[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\penguin[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil colour}}
%\penguin[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Bill colour}}
%\penguin[bill=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Belly colour}}
%\penguin[belly=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\penguin[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the penguin from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\penguin[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the penguin 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\penguin[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\penguin[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
