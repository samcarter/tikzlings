%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-snowmen}
%\end{samcode}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic snowman}}
%\snowman
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic snowman can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\snowman[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\snowman[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Nose colour}}
%\snowman[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\snowman[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Button colour}}
%\snowman[buttons=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The snowman can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\snowman[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The biggest enemy of the snowman are raising temperatures:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Global warming}}
%\snowman[globalwarming,tophat]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the snowman from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\snowman[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the snowman 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\snowman[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\snowman[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
