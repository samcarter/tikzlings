%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic elephant can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the elephant from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the elephant 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\elephant[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
