%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]

%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic elephant}}
%\elephant
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic elephant can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\elephant[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Ear colour}}
%\elephant[ears=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\elephant[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Hand colour}}
%\elephant[hands=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Belly colour}}
%\elephant[belly=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\elephant[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Tail colour}}
%\elephant[back,tail=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the elephant from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\elephant[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the elephant 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\elephant[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\elephant[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
