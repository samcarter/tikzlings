%\section[Bear]{B\"ar, the teddy bear}
%
%\emph{If you look very closely at the group picture in \href{https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb39-2/tb122wright-tug18.pdf}{TUG goes to Rio} you can spot the real B\"ar in it}
%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\lstinline|\usepackage{tikzlings-bears}| 
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic teddy bear can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the teddy bear from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the teddy bear 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bear[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Extension}
%
%The B\"ar and Ulrike Fischer wrote the fantastic \lstinline|bearwear| package, that provides many different clothing options for the \lstinline|TikZbears|. All the other \tikzlings admire them for the nice clothing!
%
%A short example:
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%%\usepackage{bearwear}
%\bear
%\bearwear[
%  long sleeves, 
%  shirt=red!80!black
%]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%Many more options and examples can be found in the package documentation \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/bearwear}.
