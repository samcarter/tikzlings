%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}

%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic bat}}
%\bat
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic bat can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\bat[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\bat[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil colour}}
%\bat[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\bat[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Ear colour}}
%\bat[ears=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\bat[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The bat can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\bat[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%With the \saminline|wings| option, one can adjust the spread of the wings. It accepts values between~0 and~1:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Wing span}}
%\bat[wings=0.5]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To turn the bat into a vampire bat, the \saminline|teeth| option can be used:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Vampire}}
%\bat[teeth=white]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the bat from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\bat[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the bat 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\bat[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\bat[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
