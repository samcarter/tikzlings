%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye circle colour}}
%\meerkat[eyecircles=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Ear colour}}
%\meerkat[ears=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Muzzle colour}}
%\meerkat[muzzle=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Nose colour}}
%\meerkat[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\meerkat[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Upper body colour}}
%\meerkat[upperbody=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Chest colour}}

%\meerkat[tail=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Tail tip colour}}
%\meerkat[tip=red]
%\end{tcblisting}

% The meerkat can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\meerkat[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The meerkat can also stand up
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Standing meerkat}}
%\meerkat[standing]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the meerkat from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\meerkat[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the meerkat 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\meerkat[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\meerkat[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
