%
%\emph{The wolf was kindly contributed by @cfroccajr. It is named ``Westy'' for the Western CT State University, whose new mascot is a wolf.}

%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\lstinline|\usepackage{tikzlings-wolves}| 
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic wolf can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The rotation angle of its arms can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[rotatearms=40]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the wolf can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[leftstep]
%\wolf[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the wolf from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the wolf 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\wolf[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
