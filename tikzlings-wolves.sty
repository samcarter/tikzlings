%
%\emph{The wolf was kindly contributed by @cfroccajr. It is named ``Westy'' for the Western CT State University, whose new mascot is a wolf.}
%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-wolves}
%\end{samcode}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic wolf}}
%\wolf
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic wolf can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\wolf[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\wolf[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil Colour}}
%\wolf[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The rotation angle of its arms can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Rotating the arms}}
%\wolf[rotatearms=40]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the wolf can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Walking}}
%\wolf[leftstep]
%\wolf[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the wolf from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\wolf[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the wolf 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\wolf[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\wolf[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
