%\emph{A friend asked me about a dog-shaped cookie cutter, so the \tikzlings got to have a dog}
%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-dogs}
%\end{samcode}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic dog}}
%\dog
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic dog can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\dog[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\dog[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Nose colour}}
%\dog[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Head colour}}
%\dog[head=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Ears colour}}
%\dog[ears=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Paw colour}}
%\dog[paws=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Tail colour}}
%\dog[tail=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the dog from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\dog[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the dog 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\dog[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\dog[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
