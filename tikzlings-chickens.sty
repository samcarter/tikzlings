%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic chicken}}
%\chicken
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic chicken can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\chicken[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Comb colour}}
%\chicken[comb=green]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\chicken[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil color}}
%\chicken[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Bill colour}}
%\chicken[bill=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\chicken[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%There is also the special option \saminline|baby| which will draw a baby chicken called \emph{Pio}:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Baby chicken}}
%\chicken[baby=yellow]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the chicken from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\chicken[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the chicken 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\chicken[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\chicken[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
