%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic bug can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[antennas=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[eye=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[pupil=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[mouth=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[arms=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[wings=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[feet=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the bug from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the bug 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bug[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
