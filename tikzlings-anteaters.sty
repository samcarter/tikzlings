%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic anteater}}
%\anteater
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic anteater can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\anteater[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\anteater[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the anteater can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Walking}}
%\anteater[leftstep]
%\anteater[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the anteater from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\anteater[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the anteater 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\anteater[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\anteater[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
