%\emph{The idea for the mouse came from an Italian \LaTeX{} user -- Tokz is a combination of the Italian word for mouse and \TikZ}

%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\lstinline|\usepackage{tikzlings-mice}| 
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic mouse can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[whiskers=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The rotation angle of its arms can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[rotatearms=40]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the mouse can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[leftstep]
%\mouse[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the mouse from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the mouse 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\mouse[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
