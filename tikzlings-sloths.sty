%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic sloth can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%If tired, the sloth can take a nap:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[sleeping]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[sleeping,eyelid=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the sloth from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the sloth 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sloth[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
