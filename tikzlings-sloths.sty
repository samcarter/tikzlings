%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic sloth}}
%\sloth
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic sloth can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\sloth[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\sloth[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\sloth[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The sloth can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\sloth[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%If tired, the sloth can take a nap:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Sleep}}
%\sloth[sleeping]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eyelid colour}}
%\sloth[sleeping,eyelids=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the sloth from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\sloth[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the sloth 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\sloth[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\sloth[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
