%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic squirrel}}
%\squirrel
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic squirrel can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\squirrel[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\squirrel[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil colour}}
%\squirrel[pupils=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\squirrel[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The squirrel can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\squirrel[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the squirrel can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Walking}}
%\squirrel[leftstep]
%\squirrel[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the squirrel from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\squirrel[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the squirrel 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\squirrel[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\squirrel[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
