%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic marmot can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The marmot can also blush
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[blush=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%and whiskers can be added:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[whiskers=gray]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%Some marmots even show their chisel teeth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[teeth=white]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%or can cast a shadow:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[shadow]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%This ability is important if you want to ask Punxsutawney Phil\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil}} on Groundhog Day how the weather is going to be. With a probability derived from the statistics of 120 Groundhog Days\footnote{\hbadness=99999\url{https://www.livescience.com/32974-punxsutawney-phil-weather-prediction-accuracy.html}} the option \lstinline|askphil| might or might not result in a shadow.
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[askphil]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%If a good weather prognosis is derived, the happy marmot can dance by lifting up its left and right foot: 
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[leftstep]
%\marmot[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the marmot from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the marmot 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\marmot[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
