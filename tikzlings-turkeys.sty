%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic turkey}}
%\turkey
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic turkey can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\turkey[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Comb colour}}
%\turkey[comb=green]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\turkey[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil color}}
%\turkey[pupils=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Bill colour}}
%\turkey[bill=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\turkey[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%There is also the special option \saminline|baby| which will draw a baby turkey called \emph{Pio}:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Baby turkey}}
%\turkey[baby=yellow]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the turkey from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\turkey[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the turkey 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\turkey[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\turkey[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
