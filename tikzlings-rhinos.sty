%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-rhinos}
%\end{samcode}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic rhino can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The hippo can also do its nails:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[toes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the rhino from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the rhino 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\rhino[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
