%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\lstinline|\usepackage{tikzlings-pigs}| 
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic pig can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[tail=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the pig from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the pig 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\pig[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
