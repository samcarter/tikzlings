%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]

%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic pig}}
%\pig
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic pig can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\pig[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\pig[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Tail colour}}
%\pig[tail=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\pig[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The pig can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\pig[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the pig from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\pig[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the pig 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\pig[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\pig[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
