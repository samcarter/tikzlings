%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic coati can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of the eyes can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The head of the coati can be rotated, but please don't overdo this, otherwise his neck might break!
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[rotatehead=-15]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%For the head an alternative sidewards facing head is available. It can be combined with the \lstinline|rotatehead| option.
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[sideward]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the coati from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the coati 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\coati[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
