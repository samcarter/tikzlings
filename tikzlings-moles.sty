%\section[Mole]{Wilhelm, the mole}
%
%\emph{The mole was added in celebration of the international mole day and is named after the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald}
%
%\subsection{Package name}
%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-moles}
%\end{samcode}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\textcolor{samred}{\textbf{Attention:} In contrast to the other \tikzlings the macro name is the plural form to avoid conflicts with  \saminline|siunitx| and similar packages.}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic mole}}
%\moles
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic mole can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\moles[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\moles[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Muzzle colour}}
%\moles[muzzle=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Hand colour}}
%\moles[hands=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Foot colour}}
%\moles[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\moles[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And the mole can lift its legs:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Walking}}
%\moles[leftstep]
%\moles[rightstep,xshift=2cm]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the mole from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\moles[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the mole 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\moles[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\moles[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
