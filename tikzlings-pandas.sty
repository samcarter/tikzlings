%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]

%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic panda}}
%\panda
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic panda can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Body colour}}
%\panda[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\panda[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Pupil colour}}
%\panda[pupils=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\panda[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The panda can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\panda[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the panda from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Back view}}
%\panda[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the panda 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\panda[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\panda[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
