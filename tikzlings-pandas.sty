%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic panda can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the panda from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the panda 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\panda[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
