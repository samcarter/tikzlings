%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Package usage}]
%\begin{samcode}
%\usepackage{tikzlings-bees}

%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Basic bee}}
%\bee
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic bee can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bee[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Antenna colour}}
%\bee[antennas=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Eye colour}}
%\bee[eyes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Mouth colour}}
%\bee[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Wing colour}}
%\bee[wings=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Hand colour}}
%\bee[hands=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Stripe colour}}
%\bee[stripes=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
% The bee can open its mouth:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Open mouth}}
%\bee[openmouth]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the bee from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={back view}}
%\bee[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \saminline|3D| will make the bee 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={3D view}}
%\bee[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \saminline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{title={Contours}}
%\bee[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
