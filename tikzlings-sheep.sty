%\emph{The sheep was kindly contributed by @Plergux. Mókollur is a bit silly and likes to goof off. This sheep's favourite food are boiled potatoes.}

%
%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\lstinline|\usepackage{tikzlings-sheep}| 
%\vspace*{0.5cm}
%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic sheep can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The sheep can also blush
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[blush=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%and put on a monocle
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[monocle]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the sheep from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the sheep 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\sheep[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
